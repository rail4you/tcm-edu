/**
 * Runtime permission requests, sent to the system one at a time.
 *
 * Android shows one permission dialog per activity at a time. A second
 * `requestPermissions` while a dialog is up never shows its own dialog: the
 * platform calls back at once with empty results. Two capabilities requested
 * close together (`:notifications` on first use, then `:location` a second
 * later) used to answer the second `:denied` without the user ever seeing it,
 * and the single pending pid/capability slot sent the first dialog's answer to
 * the second requester (MOB-391).
 *
 * So requests wait here and go to the system in order, each with its own
 * request code. Every request gets exactly one answer, sent to its own pid:
 *
 *  - already satisfied when asked: `granted` at once, without waiting behind a
 *    dialog that is up for something else;
 *  - otherwise its dialog's answer, read when that request's result arrives.
 *    A result whose code is not the request in flight is ignored, so an
 *    interrupted or stale callback never answers a different request;
 *  - empty results for the request in flight (the system cancelled or
 *    interrupted it) answer from the current permission state;
 *  - no activity to show a dialog on: `denied`.
 *
 * A capability is granted when every permission it maps to is granted, except
 * that [Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION] is also satisfied by
 * [Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION]: on Android 12+ a FINE+COARSE
 * request lets the user choose "Approximate", which grants COARSE only, and
 * that is still location access.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: call every method on the main thread.
 *
 * @param isGranted whether the app currently holds a permission.
 * @param launch shows the system dialog for `perms` under `requestCode`;
 *   returns false when there is no activity to show it on. The result comes
 *   back through [onResult], possibly before `launch` returns.
 * @param deliver sends `{:permission, cap, :granted | :denied}` to `pid`.
