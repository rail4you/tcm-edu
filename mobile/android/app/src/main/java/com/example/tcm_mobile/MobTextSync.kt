/**
 * Decides whether a controlled text field adopts the value a render carries.
 *
 * Every keystroke is sent to the BEAM, and every render it triggers comes back
 * with the value as of THAT keystroke. During a burst of typing the field is
 * already ahead of it, so adopting each one rewinds the field to a stale prefix,
 * and the keystrokes typed in between are lost or land behind the caret's old
 * position: `adb shell input text` of `QA headline reply` came out as
 * `gQeadinepl ...` (MOB-309).
 *
 * The values this field sent and has not yet seen come back are kept in order.
 * A render carrying one of them is an echo: the BEAM has processed the edits up
 * to it, and the field keeps what it shows. Anything else is the BEAM saying
 * something the field did not type: a clamp, a transform, a reset after
 * submit. The field adopts it and forgets the queue, because the edits still in
 * flight were made against text the BEAM has just replaced.
 *
 * Plain class with no Compose or Android dependency, so the JVM unit test can
 * drive it.
